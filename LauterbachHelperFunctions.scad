/* TODO:
 *   If possible, define a few helper functions to
 *   help with part placement by taking care of
 *   rotation (and if possible, shifting by component
 *   width so an x offset of 10 on the front wall is
 *   the same as an offset of 10 on the back wall.
 *   As some examples:
 *       OnBack() translate(...) <component>;
 *       OnSideOut() translate(...) <component>;
 *       OnSideIn() translate(...) <component>;
 *       OnFront() translate(...) <component);
